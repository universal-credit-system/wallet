COMMAND:

./install.sh [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION:

At execution the installer script will first check for depending programs. If any programs are
missing the script tries to identify your local package management system and installs them. The
script then creates all necessary folders and configures everything for you. It's possible to
call this script with or without any parameters. You can provide a certain user to switch to
using 'su' command just after installing the dependencies and before setting up everything.

OPTIONS:

  -env		provide a specific target environment
  -user		provide a specific user to use for the installation
  -help		display this help

./install.sh -env termux

./install.sh -user JohnDoe
